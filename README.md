### How to view the project

Follow the instructions in the git repository (<a href="https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3">server repo</a>) to download and
run the server


Project can be downloaded/cloned from this git repository (<a href="https://github.com/gmj06/mws-restaurant-stage-3-app">repo</a>). 

Follow the following steps to run the project

1. In the terminal/git bash, go the project folder
2. run 'npm install'
3. run 'gulp'
4. Make sure, server is running on http://localhost:1337 
5. In the project folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

6. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and feel free to write reviews to your favorite restaurant and also explore by writing a review when offline.
